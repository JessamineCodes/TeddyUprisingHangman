# 🧸 Love in the Time of the Teddy Bear Uprising 🧸
## The story so far
It's 2034, and it has been 10 long years since the bloody and terrible Teddy Bear Uprising. 🩸 🐻
You and your lover have led the human resistance from the start, but yesterday your heist of the Stuffing Treasury went badly wrong and your partner in rebellion and life was captured. Your love is due to be hung to death this very day 💀
Droves of teddy bears have come to witness the execution. The oversized plaid bowtie noose has been prepared. The fake cups of tea have been poured. The picnics have been laid out. 🫖
But you know that teddy bears can't resist a game, so you challenge their leader, the Prime Cuddler, to hangman. 💪
If you win, you and your lover go free. If they win, your lover will be executed, and you will turn yourself in. ⛓️
So this one's for all the eye marbles. Good luck!

## How to play
This is a terminal CLI Python game, so tno specific setup is required. Just odwnload the file and then run the hangman.py file in your terminal.

Then follow the instructions and enjoy! It's simple, it's silly, and hopefully it's slightly fun.
